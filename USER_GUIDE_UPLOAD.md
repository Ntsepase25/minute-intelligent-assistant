# How to Upload a Recording - User Guide

## Quick Start

### 1. Open Upload Dialog
Click the **"Upload New Recording"** button in the left sidebar.

### 2. Fill in Meeting Details (All Optional)

- **Meeting Date**: Select when the meeting happened

### 4. Click "Upload Recording"
The file will be uploaded and processing will begin automatically.

### 5. Wait for Processing
Your recording will appear in the sidebar with the title "Transcribing & Summarizing..." and a spinner icon.

**What's Happening:**
1. **Transcription** (~2-5 minutes): Converting speech to text
2. **Summarization** (~30-60 seconds): AI generates summary, action items, and title

The list automatically updates every 5 seconds, so you don't need to refresh!

### 6. View Results
Once processing is complete:
- The spinner disappears
- Title updates to AI-generated title (or your provided title)
- Click the recording to view transcript and summary

## Tips

### Providing a Title
- **With Title**: Your custom title is kept
- **Without Title**: AI generates a smart title from the transcript

### Google Meet Integration
If you provide a Google Meet code:
- System fetches participant names automatically
- Gets transcript with speaker attribution
- **Important**: Only works if transcription was ON during the meeting

### If Processing Fails
If you see "Processing Failed":
1. Click on the recording
2. Use the **"Regenerate Transcript"** or **"Regenerate Summary"** buttons
3. On successful regeneration, AI will generate a proper title

### Best Practices
- ‚úÖ Use clear audio with minimal background noise
- ‚úÖ Keep files under size limits (128MB audio, 256MB video)
- ‚úÖ Enable transcription during Google Meet sessions for best results
- ‚úÖ Provide participant names if Google Meet data unavailable

## Troubleshooting

### Upload Failed
- Check file size (must be under limits)
- Ensure file is audio or video format
- Check internet connection

### Stuck on "Transcribing..."
- Wait a few minutes (transcription takes time)
- Check back later - processing continues in background
- If stuck for >10 minutes, try regenerating

### "Processing Failed"
- Audio quality might be too poor
- File might be corrupted
- Try regenerating with the buttons

### No Participant Data from Google Meet
- Transcription wasn't enabled during the meeting
- Meeting might be too old
- You don't have access to that meeting
- **Solution**: Manually add participant names during upload
